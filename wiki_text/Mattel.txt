Mattel, Inc. (pronounced&#160;/məˈtɛl/; NASDAQ:&#160;MAT) is the world's largest toy company based on revenue. The products it produces include Fisher Price, Barbie dolls, Hot Wheels and Matchbox toys, Masters of the Universe, American Girl dolls, board games, and, in the early 1980s, video game consoles. The company's name is derived from Harold "Matt" Matson and Elliot Handler, who founded the company in 1945. Handler's wife, Ruth Handler, later became president, and is credited with establishing the Barbie product line for the company in 1959. After the release of the Barbie doll, Mattel revolutionized the toy industry with its talking dolls and toys. Major successes in the 1960s with the talking Chatty Cathy doll in 1960 and See 'N Say toys in 1965 moved Mattel to its position as the number one toymaker in America. Mattel closed its last factory in the United States of America, originally part of the Fisher-Price division, in 2002, outsourcing production to China, the beginning of a chain of events that led to a scandal involving lead contamination. On Friday, September 3, 2010 a small-scale "Flash Crash" appears to have occurred in Mattel shares which plunged 22% in pre-market trade for no apparent reason, only to recover shortly thereafter. Current members of the board of directors of Mattel Inc. are: Mattel announced its Global Manufacturing Principles (GMP) in 1997, designed to set safe and fair treatment of employees. In 2003, Mattel issued its first Global Reporting Initiative report to publicly assess the success of the GMP and commit to improvements. Simultaneous to this report, Mattel issued their 2004 Corporate Responsibility report, the first to be issued by a toy company. From both the 2004 and 2007 reports, a majority percentages of Mattel-owned facilities are regularly audited, it can be seen that Mattel has room to expand its supply chain auditing. Following the high-profile recalls of 2007, Mattel appointed Geoff Massingberd as Vice President of Corporate Responsibility, to lead development and implementation of programs business integrity. On June 8, 2011, Greenpeace launched "Barbie, It's Over", an international campaign criticising Mattel's use of Asia Pulp &amp; Paper's products in its packaging, particularly in its line of Barbie products. Greenpeace accuses Asia Pulp &amp; Paper of clearing Indonesian rainforests and threatening species native to those rainforests. Within two days of the campaign's start, Mattel ordered its packaging suppliers to stop buying from Asia Pulp &amp; Paper pending an investigation into Greenpeace's deforestation allegations, and further ordered its suppliers to report on how they source materials. In May 1999, at the height of the dot-com bubble, Mattel acquired The Learning Company for $3.5&#160;billion in stock or 4.5 times annual sales. The Learning Company was considered at the time one of the leading entertainment and educational software companies, owner of such titles as Reader Rabbit, Carmen Sandiego, Myst, Riven, and National Geographic, but had in 1997 accumulated losses of $475&#160;million. Mattel thought that this acquisition would help business diversification by giving the company a leading position in the market of consumer software. Mattel CEO Jill Barad expected to have direct internet sales for all Mattel's toys and predicted that Mattel sales over the Internet would reach $1&#160;billion in a few years. In the third quarter of 1999, Mattel expected The Learning Company to post $50&#160;million in profits but in reality it posted losses of $105&#160;million. Despite this loss, CEO Jill Barad continued to be optimistic. Things worsened in the fourth quarter, as The Learning Company's pre-tax losses reached $183&#160;million. For the year The Learning Company's pre-taxes losses were $206&#160;million, on revenues of $750&#160;million. The Learning Company's losses depressed Mattel's 1999 profits and as a result, Mattel posted a $82&#160;million net loss compared to a $206&#160;million net income in 1998. Mattel also warned that it would take a revamping charge of $75&#160;million to $100&#160;million in the first quarter of 2000 because of The Learning Company. By 2000, Mattel was losing $1.5&#160;million a day with The Learning Company, and Mattel's stock price (which reached a high of $45 in March 1998) traded at $11 in February 2000. Under pressure, on February 3, Mattel's CEO Jill Barad resigned but received a $50&#160;million severance package. In April Mattel announced that it was selling The Learning Company; analysts predicted that The Learning Company could be sold for $400&#160;million, then for $200&#160;million. In the end, in October, The Learning Company was sold to Gores Technology for nothing other than a percentage of The Learning Company's future profits. In addition Mattel cut 10% of its workforce to further cut costs. As a result of this restructuring Mattel posted a net loss of $430&#160;million for the year 2000. On August 2, 2007, Mattel's Fisher-Price subsidiary recalled almost one million Chinese-made toys, including Dora the Explorer and Sesame Street toys, because of potential hazards from parts of the toys which were colored using lead-based paint that may have exceeded the US Federal limit of 600 parts per million. In worst cases, Mattel toys' lead in paint was found to be 180 times the limit. The paint on the toys was up to 11% lead, or 110,000 parts per million. U.S. Federal law allows just 0.06% lead, or 600 parts per million. Children who suck on or ingest toys or jewelry with high lead content may be poisoned, which can lead to learning and behavior problems, even death in some cases. On August 14, 2007, Mattel recalled over 18 million products because it was possible that they could pose a danger to children due to the use of strong magnets that may detach. Strong small magnets could be dangerous to the children if two or more were ingested, attracting each other in the intestines and causing damage. Some instances were reported. A child swallowed a Polly Pocket toy magnet and had to undergo a surgery. At the time of the recall, none of the U.S. or European safety legislation and standards addressed the specific hazard of strong magnets. Some of the products had been available in U.S. stores since 2003, during which time Mattel did not consider them harmful enough to warrant a recall. After incidents with similar magnetic toy parts being swallowed, causing perforation of the intestines, Mattel re-wrote its policy on magnets, finally issuing this recall in August 2007. Recalled items included die-cast Cars character, Sarge, made between May and July 2007, found to have been manufactured using paint containing higher than acceptable levels of lead (436,000 recalled globally), 7.1&#160;million Polly Pocket toys produced before November 2006; 600,000 Barbie and Tanner Playsets; 1 million Doggie Daycare; Shonen Jump's One Piece; and thousands of Batman Manga toys due to exposed magnets. 18.2&#160;million items were recalled in total. Zhang Shuhong, co-owner of the Lee Der Toy Company, which had made a number of toys for Mattel, committed suicide by hanging himself at one of his company's factories in Foshan on August 11, 2007, according to authorities. Lee Der ceased business. On September 4, 2007, Mattel recalled a further 530,000 affected toys in the United States – and 318,000 outside the United States – after its intensive testing found that the Chinese-made products contained levels of lead in painted parts that were above the acceptable limit set by the company. This third recall in a month included accessories for Barbie dolls and Fisher-Price toys. On June 5, 2009, the Consumer Product Safety Commission fined Mattel and its Fisher-Price division $2.3&#160;million dollars for violation of Code 16 of Federal Regulations CFR 1303, the Federal lead paint ban. While Mattel agreed to the fine, no wrong doing was admitted on the companies part. Among others, Fortune magazine rated the recall of Mattel's products as one of the 'Dumbest Moments' in business for 2007. Mattel has increased audits and testing of all products. In August 2007, CEO Robert Eckert said, "We were let down, and so we let you down," referring to the three massive product recalls for lead contamination of paint. On September 21, 2007, Mattel's Executive Vice-President for worldwide operations, Thomas Debrowski, traveled to Beijing. In a meeting with China's product safety chief, Li Chanjiang, Debrowski took full responsibility for the magnet recalls and said that, "vast majority of those products that were recalled were the result of a design flaw in Mattel's design, not through a manufacturing flaw in China’s manufacturers." Reading a prepared text, he continued, "Mattel takes full responsibility for these recalls and apologises personally to you, the Chinese people, and all of your customers who received the toys." In March 2005, Mattel partnered with Oasys Mobile to extend their market into the mobile field. The partnership was announced on March 16, 2005 and gave Oasys Mobile the right to produce games on such licenses as UNO, Ker Plunk!, Toss Across, and Rock'em Sock'em Robots. Since then the two have worked together to add such licenses as the Barbie, Magic 8 Ball and Max Steel IPs to Oasys' portfolio. These subsequent partnerships also extended the territories in which they could market their products. The new markets included Japan and Taiwan for the Barbie license and Japan, China, Korea, India, and the Philippines for the UNO license. In late 2009, Mattel signed a deal to make WWE toys from 2010. The deal has proven to be successful for WWE, garnering nearly $52 million in toy and related merchandise sales in 2010, compared to $44.7 million the previous year. Some of the lawsuits involving Mattel are as follows: Mattel distributed Nintendo's products in Canada from 1986 to 1990, the UK until 1990 when Nintendo Computer Entertainment UK was established, and Australia from 1987 to early 1994 when Hiroshi Yamauchi opened Nintendo Australia Pty Ltd, Nintendo's only privately owned subsidiary and had Susumu Tanaka from Nintendo UK Ltd and Graham Kerry from Mattel Australia Pty Ltd as the first Managing Directors of the subsidiary. Mattel's international revenue accounts for 49% of its gross sale in 2007, coming from regions like Europe, Latin America and Asia.
