A cordillera is an extensive chain of mountains or mountain ranges, that runs along a coastline (e.g. the Andes). It comes from the Spanish word cordilla, which is a diminutive of cuerda, or "cord". This term may be encountered in various scientific fields, but it has historically been used particularly in the field of physical geography.
