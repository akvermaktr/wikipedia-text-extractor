TCS has offices in over 47 countries with more than 142 branches across the globe and is a subsidiary of textiles and manufacturing conglomerate Tata Group.TCS accounts for India’s 20 per cent IT exports. It began as the "Tata Computer Centre", for the company Tata Group whose main business was to provide computer services to other group companies. F C Kohli was the first general manager. J. R. D. Tata was the first chairman, followed by Pankaj Roy. One of TCS' first assignments was to provide punched card services to a sister concern, Tata Steel (then TISCO). It later bagged the country's first software project, the Inter-Branch Reconciliation System (IBRS) for the Central Bank of India. It also provided bureau services to Unit Trust of India, thus becoming one of the first companies to offer BPO services. In the early 1970s, Tata Consultancy Services started exporting its services. The company pioneered the global delivery model for IT services with its first offshore client in 1974. TCS's first international order came from Burroughs, one of the first business computer manufacturers. TCS was assigned to write code for the Burroughs machines for several US-based clients. This experience also helped TCS bag its first onsite project - the Institutional Group &amp; Information Company (IGIC), a data centre for ten banks, which catered to two million customers in the US, assigned TCS the task of maintaining and upgrading its computer systems. In 1981, TCS set up India's first software research and development centre, the Tata Research Development and Design Center (TRDDC) in Pune. The first client-dedicated offshore development center was set up for Compaq (then Tandem) in 1985. In 1979, TCS delivered an electronic depository and trading system called SECOM for SIS SegaInterSettle, Switzerland. It was by far the most complex project undertaken by an Indian IT company. TCS followed this up with System X for the Canadian Depository System and also automated the Johannesburg Stock (JSE). TCS associated with a Swiss partner, TKS Teknosoft, which it later acquired. In the early 1990s, the Indian IT outsourcing industry grew tremendously due to the Y2K bug and the launch of a unified European currency, Euro.
