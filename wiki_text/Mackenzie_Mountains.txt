The Mackenzie Mountains are a mountain range forming part of the Yukon-Northwest Territories boundary between the Liard and Peel rivers. The range is named in honour of Canada's second Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie. Nahanni National Park Reserve is in the Mackenzie Mountains. The Mackenzie Mountains hold about 55% of the world's known reserves of tungsten. The mining town of Tungsten, site of the Cantung Mine is in the Mackenzie Mountains. Only two roads lead into the Mackenzie Mountains, both in the Yukon: the Nahanni Range Road leading to the townsite of Tungsten and the Canol Road leading to the Macmillan Pass. The highest mountain in this range is Keele Peak at 2,972&#160;m (9,751&#160;ft). The second highest mountain is Mount Nirvana. It is, at 2,773&#160;m (9,098&#160;ft), the highest mountain in the Northwest Territories.
