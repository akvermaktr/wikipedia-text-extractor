Swisscom AG is a major telecommunications provider in Switzerland. Along with Swiss Post, it is a successor company to the former state-owned PTT. Its headquarters are located at Worblaufen near Bern. The Swiss Confederation owns 56.94 percent of Swisscom. The former state-owned PTT (Post, Telegraph, Telephone, founded 1852) was privatised in stages from 1988 onwards and became a public limited company with special legal status in October 1998. The Swiss Confederation currently holds 56.94% of the share capital. The Telecommunications Companies Act limits outside participation to 49.9% of the share capital. In its 5 April 2006 message, the Federal Council proposed to Parliament that Swisscom should be completely privatised and that the Swiss Confederation should sell its shares in stages . On 10 May 2006, the National Council declined to support the proposal. On 20 May 2006 the Advisory Committee of the Council of States advised the Council of States to endorse the proposal – but only so that it could be referred back to the Federal Council for revision.
