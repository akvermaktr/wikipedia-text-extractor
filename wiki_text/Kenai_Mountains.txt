The Kenai Mountains are a mountain range in the U.S. state of Alaska. They extend 192&#160;km (120&#160;mi) northeast from the southern end of the Kenai Peninsula to the Chugach Mountains. The Harding and Sargent Icefields, as well as the many glaciers that originate from them, derive in the Kenai Mountains. Several prime fish-producing rivers, including the Kenai River and the Russian River, also flow from the mountains. The name "Kenai" was first published by Constantin Grewingk in 1849, who obtained his information from I. G. Wosnesenski's account of a voyage to the area in 1842. The Kenai Indian's name for the mountain range is "Truuli." Coordinates: 59°41′32″N 150°36′56″W﻿ / ﻿59.69222°N 150.61556°W﻿ / 59.69222; -150.61556
