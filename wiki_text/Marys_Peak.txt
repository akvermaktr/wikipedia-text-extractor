Marys Peak (formerly Mary's Peak and sometimes still spelled this way) is a mountain in Benton County, Oregon, United States, just southwest of Philomath. It is the highest peak in the Oregon Coast Range. It is also the highest point in Benton County, and ranks eleventh in the state for prominence. On a clear day at the top of the peak, facing east, northeast, and southeast, one can see the cities and suburbs of the Willamette Valley, as well as the Cascade Range. To the west, the Pacific Ocean is visible on clear days. The road to the peak now remains open in the winter. During the 2010-2011 winter the Forest Service announced they will leave the gates open to facilitate travel to the summit. The road will not be maintained so a lifted 4x4 or 4 wheel chains are required for access during the winter months.
