Sanmina-SCI Corporation (NASDAQ:&#160;SANM) is a global electronics manufacturing services (EMS) provider headquartered in San Jose, California that serves original equipment manufacturers in technology-related industries such as communications and computer hardware. Sanmina-SCI has nearly 80 manufacturing sites. The company is the world’s largest independent manufacturer of backplanes. The company was founded by Milan Mandarić and Jure Sola in 1980, as a printed circuit manufacturer. By the end of the 1980s, the company expanded to backplanes and subassemblies. In December 2001, Sanmina acquired rival SCI Systems of Huntsville, Alabama for $6 billion in cash, stock, and debt. Although Sanmina was only half as large as SCI at the time, it was in a better financial position because its core telecommunications business was performing well, whereas SCI's lower-margin businesses such as personal computer manufacturing, were struggling. Shortly after, Sanmina bought E-M Solutions, a Fremont, California electronics manufacturer, for $110 million in cash. Then in early 2002, Sanmina acquired Viking Interworks of Rancho Santa Margarita for $15 million ($10.9 million in cash and 390,000 shares of Sanmina stock worth $10.26 per share at the time). Today, the San Jose, CA based company has 41,000 employees in over 20 countries. It serves clients in the fields of communications, computing, multimedia, semiconductors, defense, aerospace, medical applications, and automotive technology. It provides "end-to-end" manufacturing services for these clients (including consulting, design, engineering, logistics, new product introduction, assembly, machining, and fabrication), to produce printed circuit boards, backplanes, cables, injection-molded plastics, enclosures and frames, optics. It is ranked number 188 in the Fortune 500 list of the top 500 United States public corporations.
