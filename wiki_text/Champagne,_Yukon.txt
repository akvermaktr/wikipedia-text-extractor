Champagne Landing is a small Indian settlement on the Alaska Highway (historical mile 968, between Whitehorse and Haines Junction) in Canada's Yukon. The few residents are citizens of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations. The resident population was 24 in the Canada 2006 Census. Champagne is on the Dezadeash River, one of the tributaries of the Alsek. The settlement was on the original Dalton Trail, and a roadhouse was built there in 1902. The Alaska highway no longer routes through the community, having been rerouted in the fall of 2002, but the old roadway is still open to provide access.
