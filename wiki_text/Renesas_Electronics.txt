Renesas Electronics Corporation (ルネサス エレクトロニクス株式会社, Runesasu Erekutoronikusu Kabushiki Gaisha?) TYO: 6723 is a Japanese semiconductor manufacturer. It is based in Tokyo and has manufacturing, design and sales operations in around 20 countries. Renesas is one of the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductor systems for mobile phones and automotive applications. It is the world's largest manufacturer of microcontrollers and the second largest manufacturer of application processors. Renesas is also known for LCD drivers, RF ICs, mixed-signal integrated circuits and system-on-a-chip semiconductors. The largest stockholders and their ownership ratio of Renesas are as follows. Renesas Electronics started operation in April 2010, through the integration of NEC Electronics Corporation and Renesas Technology Corporation. NEC Electronics was established in November 2002 by a spin-off of the semiconductor operations of NEC. Renesas Technology was established on April 1, 2003, as a joint venture of Hitachi, Ltd. (55%) and Mitsubishi Electric (45%). In April 2009, Renesas Technology and NEC Electronics reached a basic agreement to merge by around April 2010. On April 1, 2010 NEC Electronics and Renesas Technology merged forming Renesas Electronics which became the fourth largest semiconductor company according to iSuppli published data. The product range includes a wide variety of semiconductor components, such as:  The M16C is a 16-bit embedded microcontroller originally developed and manufactured by Mitsubishi Semiconductor. It is available in a number of different versions with various amounts of flash memory and uses the same instruction set across the range which allows engineers to keep the same code base and development tools. The R8C is an 8-bit microcontroller with a 16-bit ALU. It was developed as a cost-effective version of the M16C. It retains the M16C's 16-bit CISC core architecture and instruction set, but trades performance for size by reducing the internal data bus from 16-bits to 8-bits. It is available in a number of different versions with up to 128KB of flash memory and SRAM. All R8C microcontrollers have an internal ring oscillator and can be used without external resonators. Common interfaces are UART and the R8C/22 and R8C/23 devices have CAN interfaces. Some devices have internal data flash memory, which is meant as a replacement for serial EEPROM, although it handles fewer write cycles than a real serial EEPROM. R8C devices also feature on-chip debugging (see In-circuit emulator). The R32C is a 32-bit microcontroller originally developed by Renesas as a 32-bit version of the M16C. It is available in a number of different versions with up to 1MB of flash memory and up to 48KB of RAM. H8 is the name of a large family of 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers originally developed in the early 1990s by Hitachi Semiconductor. The RX family of 32-bit CISC microcontrollers was introduced in 2009 and is marketed as a successor to the M16C and R32C products. SuperH is a 32-bit embedded RISC microcontroller originally developed and manufactured in the early 1990s by Hitachi Semiconductor. V850 is a 32-bit embedded RISC microcontroller originally developed and manufactured by NEC, succeeded by V850 variants named V850ES, V850E, and V850E2 which run uClinux. RL78 Family is Renesas Electronics' microcontroller family combining advanced features from both the 78K and R8C families to deliver low power consumption and high performance. Renesas developes AUTOSAR MCAL solutions for several devices. see also About AUTOSAR  DKB Group&#160;· HDMI Licensing&#160;· Hitachi 3Tours Championship&#160;· Hitachi Data Systems History&#160;· The Hitachi Foundation&#160;· Hindu Hitachi Scholarships&#160;· Hitachi SunRockers&#160;· Kashiwa Reysol Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment&#160;· Mitsubishi Electric Championship at Hualalai&#160;· Mitsubishi Electric Cup&#160;· Mitsubishi Electric Diamond Dolphins&#160;· Mitsubishi Electric Koalas&#160;· Mitsubishi Foundation NEC Blue Rockets&#160;· NEC Cup (China)&#160;· NEC Cup (Japan)&#160;· NEC Green Rockets&#160;· NEC Karuizawa 72&#160;· NEC Red Rockets&#160;· NEC Shun-Ei&#160;· Sumitomo Group Acer (Gateway)&#160;· Apple&#160;· ASUS&#160;· Dell&#160;· Fujitsu&#160;· HP&#160;· Lenovo&#160;· NEC&#160;· Toshiba Advanced Micro Devices&#160;· Broadcom&#160;· Elpida Memory&#160;· Freescale Semiconductor&#160;· Hynix&#160;· Infineon Technologies&#160;· Intel&#160;· Marvell Technology Group&#160;· MediaTek&#160;· Micron Technology&#160;· Nvidia&#160;· NXP&#160;· Panasonic&#160;· Qualcomm&#160;· Renesas Electronics&#160;· Samsung&#160;· Sony&#160;· STMicroelectronics&#160;· Texas Instruments&#160;· Toshiba&#160;· VIA Technologies Amazon.com&#160;· Baidu&#160;· eBay&#160;· Facebook&#160;· Google&#160;· Yahoo!
