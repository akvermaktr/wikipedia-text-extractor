Urchin is a web statistics analysis program developed by Urchin Software Corporation. Urchin is used to analyze web server log file content and display the traffic information on that website based upon the log data. Urchin software can be run in two different data collection modes; log file analyser or hybrid. As a log file analyser, Urchin processes web server log files in a variety of log file formats. Custom file formats can also be defined. As a hybrid, Urchin combines page tags with log file data to eradicate the limitations of each data collection method in isolation. The result is more accurate web visitor data. Urchin has become one of the more popular solutions for website traffic analysis, particularly with ISPs and web hosting providers. This is largely due to its scalability in performance and pricing model. While Urchin Software Corp. was acquired by Google in April 2005, the Urchin 5 and prior analysis programs are still widely used and available today. In April 2008, Google released the next version called Urchin 6. In February 2009, Google released Urchin 6.5, integrating AdWords. Urchin 7 was released in September 2010 and includes 64-bit support, new UI and event tracking among other features.
