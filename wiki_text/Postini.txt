Postini is an e-mail and Web security and archiving service owned by Google since 2007. It provides cloud computing services for filtering e-mail spam and malware (before it is delivered to a client's mail server), offers optional e-mail archiving, and protects client networks from web-borne malware. Postini was a startup company founded in 1999 by Shinya Akamine, Gordon Irlam, Brian Maggi, and Scott Petry in Redwood City, California, United States. It was backed by August Capital, with second-round funding from August as well as Summit Partners Accelerator Fund and Sun Microsystems. By February 2005, it was operating ten U.S. data centers, processing 2.5 billion e-mail messages weekly, and providing anti-spam services for more than 4,200 companies and "6 million end users, including workers at Merrill Lynch, Circuit City, Rayovac, and Hormel Foods, the company that makes Spam, the canned meat product." Later in 2005 it moved to nearby San Carlos, California. On 9 July 2007, Google announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Postini. Google spent $625 million in cash for the acquisition. The former company's services are now marketed as "Google Postini Services." In September 2011, Google announced it would discontinue a number of its products, including Google Web Security which was acquired by Google as part of Postini.
