Telecom Italia is the largest Italian telecommunications company, also active in the media and manufacturing industries. Now a private concern listed on the Borsa Italiana, it was founded in 1994 by the merger of several state-owned telecommunications companies, the most important of which was Società Italiana per l'Esercizio Telefonico p.A. (known as SIP in line with the earlier Società Idroelettrica Piemontese - Piemontese hydroelectric society), the monopoly telephone operator in Italy. The company operates landline telephone services in Italy, GSM mobile phone services in Italy and Brazil through its TIM subsidiary, and DSL internet and telephony services under the brand Alice in Italy and San Marino. It also owns a stake in Telecom Argentina. Telecom Italia also controls one of the main Italian television companies, Telecom Italia Media, and owns Olivetti, the manufacturer of computer peripherals and other hardware. Telecom Italia was created in 1994 by the merger of several telecommunications companies among which Sip, Iritel, Italcable, Telespazio and Sirm. In 1995 the mobile telephony division was spun off into Tim (Telecom Italia Mobile). Interbusiness, Italy’s largest Internet network, was created and around the same time with TIN (Telecom Italia Net) and the first ISPs, Internet became a reality in Italy too. In 1996 Tim was one of the first companies in the world to introduce a new prepaid rechargeable phone card (GSM) and one year later launched the short messaging service (SMS) capability. In 1997 Telecom Italia was privatised and was transformed into a large multimedia group. After the reorganization of editorial activities, in 2005 Telecom Italia acquired Tin.it and Virgilio from Telecom Italia Media, the multimedia company of the Group. Telecom Italia Media, born in 2003 from Seat Pagine Gialle, focused its business on television sector with La7 and MTV channels. Nowadays Telecom Italia Group operates also into the fast-growing South America market: in Brazil with TIM Brasil and in Argentina and Paraguay with Telecom Argentina Group.
