Marissa Ann Mayer (born on May 30, 1975) is Vice President of Location and Local Services at the search engine company Google. She has become one of the public faces of Google, providing a number of press interviews and appearing at events frequently to speak on behalf of the company. After graduating from Wausau West High School in 1993, Mayer was one of two delegates from Wisconsin selected by the Governor of that state to attend the National Youth Science Camp in West Virginia. Mayer received her B.S. in Symbolic systems, graduating with honors, and M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford University. For both degrees, she specialized in artificial intelligence. In 2009, the Illinois Institute of Technology granted Mayer an honoris causa doctorate degree honoring her pathfinding work in the field of search. Mayer was the first female engineer hired at Google and one of their first 20 employees, joining the company in June 1999. Prior to joining Google, Mayer worked at the UBS research lab (Ubilab) in Zurich, Switzerland, and at SRI International in Menlo Park, California. Mayer has notable public involvement with Google Search and Gmail, and can be considered significantly responsible for the success of these UIs. Fortune magazine lists her as one of the 50 most powerful women in the world and the youngest woman ever to make the list. Mayer has been named as one of Glamour Magazineâ€™s 2009 Women of the Year.
