Maxim Integrated Products (NASDAQ:&#160;MXIM) is a publicly traded company that designs, manufactures, and sells analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products. Maxim develops integrated circuits (ICs) for the industrial, communications, consumer, and computing markets. Headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, Maxim has design centers, manufacturing facilities, and sales offices throughout the world. In 2011 Maxim had $2.47 billion in sales, 9,300 employees, and 35,000 customers worldwide. Maxim Integrated Products was founded in April 1983. Its nine initial team members had a variety of experience in semiconductors design and sales. Based on a two-page business plan, they obtained $9 million in venture capital to establish the company. In the first year, the company developed 24 second source products. After that, Maxim designed proprietary products that offered greater differentiation and higher profits. Maxim recorded its first profitable fiscal year in 1987, and posted a profit every year since it went public in 1988. Annual revenue reached $500 million in fiscal year 1998 and in fiscal 2011 totaled over $2.47 billion. As of 2011 the company sold a wide variety of analog and mixed-signal devices, with thousands of different products. Of about 9,300 employees, approximately 4,500 were employed in the United States. Tunç Doluca became chief executive officer in January 2007. Maxim has said it eschewed a strategy of growth through acquisition. Nonetheless, the company has made the following acquisitions: 1990: Purchased first wafer fabrication (fab) facility in Sunnyvale, California. 1994: Acquired Tektronix Semiconductor Division in Beaverton, Oregon, giving Maxim high-speed bipolar processes for wireless RF and fiber-optic products. 1997: Purchased an additional wafer fab from IC Works in San Jose, California, to increase fab capacity. 2001: Acquired Dallas Semiconductor in Dallas, Texas, to gain expertise in digital and mixed-signal CMOS design, as well as an additional wafer fab. 2003: Purchased submicrometre CMOS fab from Philips in San Antonio, Texas, to ramp up capacity and support processes down to the 0.25-micrometre level. 2007: Purchased 0.18-micrometre fab from Atmel in Irving, Texas, approximately doubling fab capacity. 2007: Acquired Vitesse Semiconductor’s Storage Products Division in Colorado Springs, Colorado, adding Serial ATA (SATA), Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), and enclosure-management products to Maxim’s product portfolio. 2008: Acquired Mobilygen in Santa Clara, California, to add H.264 video-compression technology to its portfolio. 2009: Acquired Innova Card, headquartered in La Ciotat, France, for the financial transaction terminal semiconductor market. 2009: Acquired two product lines from Zilog, Inc. Maxim purchased the Secure Transactions product line, featuring the Zatara family of single-chip solutions, and the hardware portion of Zilog's Wireless Control product line, whose Crimzon and classic IR solutions are commonly found in universal remote controls. 2010: Acquired privately held Teridian Semiconductor Corporation for approximately $315 million in cash. Teridian was a fabless semiconductor company located in Irvine, California, supplying systems on a chip (SoC) for the smart meter market. 2010: Maxim acquired the technology and employees of Trinity Convergence Limited, a software company based in Cambridge, U.K. Trinity was part of the ecosystem to bring Skype video conferencing to the LCD TV market. 2010: Maxim acquired Phyworks, a supplier of optical transceiver chips for the broadband communications market. 2011: Maxim acquired SensorDynamics, a semiconductor company that develops proprietary sensor and microelectromechanical (MEMS) solutions. Maxim designs, manufactures, and sells analog, mixed-signal, high-frequency, and digital circuits. Its product portfolio includes categories serving industrial, communications, consumer, and computing markets. Maxim’s product lines include: 1-Wire and iButton devices; amplifiers and comparators; analog switches and multiplexers; audio/video; automotive; clock generation and distribution; analog-to-digital converters; digital-to-analog converters; digital potentiometers; analog filters; high-frequency ASICs; hot-swap and power switching; interface and interconnect; memories (volatile, nonvolatile, multifunction); microcontrollers; military/aerospace; optoelectronics; battery and power management; powerline networking; protection and isolation; real-time clocks; storage products; microprocessor supervisors; T/E carrier and packetized communications; thermal management; voltage references; wireless, RF, and cable. Starting in 1990, the company made the transition to using over 160 fabrication processes for its wafers in its own facilities. From October 2007 to October 2008, Maxim's common stock was delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Exchange due to the company's inability to file financial statements related to stock option backdating. Maxim's stock was traded over-the-counter and quoted on the Pink Sheets until the company completed its restatement in 2008. Maxim's founder and CEO, Jack Gifford and CFO Carl Jasper resigned due to an investigation into the issue by Maxim's board of directors. Maxim restated its earnings in September 2008 and was relisted on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange on October 8, 2008.
