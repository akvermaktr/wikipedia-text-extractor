NXP Semiconductors is one of the Worldwide Top 20 Semiconductor Sales Leaders, and was originally founded by Philips more than 50 years ago. Formerly known as Philips Semiconductors, the company was sold by Philips to a consortium of private equity investors in 2006. The new name, NXP, stood for the consumer's "next experience", according to then-CEO Frans van Houten. On August 6, 2010, NXP completed its IPO, with shares trading on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol NXPI. NXP Semiconductors provides High Performance Mixed Signal and Standard Product solutions based on its RF, analog, power management, interface, security and digital processing expertise. More informally, NXP has characterized its strategy as focusing on "products with no big chip in the middle." These semiconductors are used in a wide range of "smart" automotive, identification, wireless infrastructure, lighting, industrial, mobile, consumer and computing applications. Headquartered in the Netherlands, the company has approximately 28,000 employees working in more than 25 countries and posted sales of USD 4.4 billion in 2010. NXP is the co-inventor of NFC or Near Field Communication technology along with Sony, and supplies NFC chip sets which enable mobile phones to be used to pay for goods, and store and exchange data securely. NXP ranks No. 1 in chips for eGovernment applications such as electronic passports; No. 1 in transport and access management, with the chip set and contactless card for MIFARE used by many major public transit systems worldwide; and is No. 1 in RFID tags and labels. In addition, NXP is the global market leader in many other areas, including automotive chips for in-vehicle networking, passive keyless entry and immobilization, and car radios, as well as silicon tuners for the TV and set-top-box market. As of February 2011, NXP had shipped over one billion ARM processor-based chips and is the only provider of microcontrollers with a roadmap exclusively on 32-bit ARM architecture. According to CEO Rick Clemmer, key growth areas for NXP include energy-efficient GreenChip technology for power and lighting, telematics, authentication technology, and solutions for the Smart Home or home automation market. NXP is also involved in sensors for various applications such as automotive, white goods and home appliances, industrial automation, and building automation.
